            We process your personal data based on your consent (for example, if you give us permission to send invitations for events or newsletters), the execution of the agreement (for example, when processing and sending a product or service you ordered on our website), a legal obligation we may be subject to, or on the basis of a legitimate interest (for example, to improve our website).

            If you have given consent for the processing of your personal data, you can always withdraw that consent by sending us an email (see the contact information on our website). The withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of the processing up until the moment of withdrawal.
